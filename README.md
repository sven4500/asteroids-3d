# Asteroids 3D

This is an extremely simple Asteroids 3D video game made with Unity.

You are flying through the asteroid belt and your space ship is damaged. Manoeuvres are a little bit unpredictable. With a laser weapon installed on board of your space ship you can destroy asteroids flying towards you. The goal of this game is to survive as long as possible. Each destroyed asteroid gives you one extra point.

You can navigate your ship by pressing WASD keys and fire a short laser beam by pressing the space button.
